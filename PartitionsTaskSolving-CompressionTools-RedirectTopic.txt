step 00 = echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan = to discover new inserted storage to sd* drivers
step 0 = fdisk -l = to longlist all sd* driver
step 1 = fdisk
step 2 = create partition
step 3 = press w to save partition table
       = press p to print all child drivers in specific parent driver from fdisk menu
       = press d to delete specific child driver from fdisk menu
step 4 = partx -a /dev/sd*  or partprobe /dev/sd* = to update kernal table 
(in case if system reboots then no need to run this command)

step 5 = format disk = using mkfs.ext3 or mkfs.ext4 /dev/sd* ,
type mkfs & press tab key = to see all available formatting methods
there are different types of formatting commands (ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, cramfs, fat, msdos, btrfs, minix, vfat) 
some other fs formates (ZFS, GFS, HDFS, CIFS, NFS)
there is no thumb rule to use any specific format for any specific version
Format          ext2    ext3    ext4    xfs

step 6 = mkdir <folder-name>
step 7 = mount /dev/sd* /<dir-name> = to mount driver to a folder
step 8 = df -h = check mounted partition

this mount is not persistent it is loaded into ram if machine is reloaded then  the partition will be unmount
so to make it persistent & auto mount  we have to add it inot /etc/fstab file
why to add into fstab file ? because it's a boot process file means it loads when machine 
load/boots it stores mounting details
fstab means = file system table, it is said to be 9th critical file in linux
Q: how many fields in fstab file?
A: There are 6 fields

umount /<dir-name>/ = to unmount partition
-----------------
/etc/fstab
it is used to create automount on system reboot, it has 6 arguments
1 - device driver
2 - mount point
3 - fileSystem type
4 - permission
5 - fsckdump
6 - fsck on off sequence

for example:
/dev/sdb1            /phpmyadmin          ext4               default         0           0
(device driver)      (mount point)   (fileSystem type)    (permission)   (fsckdump)   (fsckOnOffSequence)

in v6 or earlier

add mount device as like given example above

in v7/8

add mount device as like given example above
or
blkid = this command create UUID for all device drivers

UUID                       /<dir-name>        fileSystemType     default          0                0 
(device driver UUID)      (mount point)   (fileSystem type)    (permission)   (fsckdump)   (fsckOnOffSequence)

ls > filename = to add/overwrite all list data to file
ls -l > filename = to add/overwrite all list data to file
history > filename = to add/overwrite all history data to file

append ">>"
ls >> filename = to append all list data to file without overwriting previous data
ls -l >> filename = to append all list data to file without overwriting previous data
history >> filename = to append all history data to file without overwriting previous data


gzip <file-name> = to compress file
gzip -d <file-name> = to decompress file
