there is two types of links :
1 - softlink/symbolic/symlink : a shortcut like windows can be cross partition with new file inode
if orignal file is deleted then you can not access content from softlink file
but if you delete softlink file it does not effect on orignal file and 
is esay to access

2 - Hardlink : a type of backup of a file but if all data from same prtition is 
deleted then it ha no benifit and can not be crossed partition 
because it creates same inode num for hardlink file like orignal one because
there could be anyother file with same inode

soflink = ln -s <orginal-file-path-with-name> <shorcut-path-with-file-name>
hardlink = ln <orginal-file-path-with-name> <shorcut-path-with-file-name>

ls -lh <shortcut-file-name> = to check link between orignal and shortcut
ls -ilh <both-file-name> =  to check i node num and file counter on both orginal 
and hardlink files

find <path-of-orignal-and-hardlink-file> -inum <inode-num> = to find number 
of files with same inode num

df -h = to check partition in the operating system
cp <file-name> <copy-path> = to copy and paste file from one location 
to another

mv <filePath/fileName> <move FilePath> =  to cut & paste file from one location
to another

mv <fileName> <new Name> = to rename file in current directory
mv <filePath/fileName> <move Path/fileName> = to rename and move file
