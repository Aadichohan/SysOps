--- Run Level ---
run level are between 0-6
runlevel = to check current runlevel
init <level-num> = to migrate to specific runlevel

--- in CentOs 6 or older ---
press arrow to interupt and press a to modify
and press 1 then it goes to the root directly without password
then can update  root password

-- reset root passwd CentOs 7/8--
reboot and press up arrow key on splash screen
& then press e then find linux16 by pressing down key
then add rd.break end of this line after LANG=en_US.UTF-8
and press ctrl x
then run mount -o remount,rw /sysroot 
&  chroot /sysroot
then run echo “New-root-password” | passwd --stdin root
& touch /.autorelabel
& then reboot -f

-- Runlevel chart --
Runlevel 0 = shuts down the system

Runlevel 1 = single-user mode

Runlevel 2 = multi-user mode without networking (without NFS)

Runlevel 3 = multi-user mode with networking (terminal)

Runlevel 4 = user-definable (unused)

Runlevel 5 = multi-user mode with networking (GUI)

Runlevel 6 = reboots the system to restart it

cd /opt
mkdir maven
cd maven
touch mongo
chmod 000 mongo
cd ..
drwxr-xr-x 1 aadi aadi maven
chmod 551 maven
now user can not delete mongo file inside maven folder

if all user in group have write permision for sirectory 
and file permmsion are off then group users can delete file 
if dont have permission then can not delete file


if we remove all permission from file using octal or symbolic way
then others can not delete file and owner or root user can delete that file
using inherited permission
 it uses inherited permission from parent  directory
if parent directory has no  write permission then owner can not also delete file

Assign/Remove user a group 
usermod -aG <group-name> <user-name>   = assign suplimentory group to user
gpasswd -a <user-name> <group-name>    = assign group to user
usermod -G "" <group-name> <user-name> = remove all other group 
gpasswd --delete <user-name> <group-name> = remove any specific group from user


-- change attribute --
chattr = command is used to change file/folder attribute
i = i is flag stands for immutable
a = a is a flag stands for append

chattr +i <file-name> = to make file immutable even root can not delete it
& file can not be updated
chattr -i <filr-name> = to remove file immutable attribute

lsattr <file-name> =  to check if chattr +i is set 

-- permission --
r = read  = 4
w = write = 2
x = exec  = 1
symbolic way = u+rwx, u+r-w+x, g+rwx, g-r+w-x, o+rwx, o-rwx
octal way    = u+rwx = 7, u+r-w+x = 5, g-r+w-x = 2, o-rwx = 0

chmod -Rv 755 maven 
chmod -Rv <octal-num> <folder-name> = apply permission on all child files &
folder inside a dir

-- access control list ---
user specific permission
u = user
g = group
o = other
setfacl -m u:<username>:rwx <file/folder> = to add specific user acl
setfacl -x u:<username> <file/folder> = to remove specific user acl

setfacl -m g:<groupname>:rwx <file/folder> = to add specific group acl
setfacl -x g:<groupname> <file/folder> = to remove specific group acl

setfacl -m o:rwx <file/folder> = to add other acl

getfacl <file/folder> = to get all permission
