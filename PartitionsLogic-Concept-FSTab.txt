step 00 = echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan = to discover new inserted storage to sd* drivers
step 0 = fdisk -l = to longlist all sd* driver
step 1 = fdisk
step 2 = create partition
step 3 = press w to save partition table
       = press p to print all child drivers in specific parent driver from fdisk menu
       = press d to delete specific child driver from fdisk menu
step 4 = partx -a /dev/sd*  or partprobe /dev/sd* = to update kernal table 
(in case if system reboots then no need to run this command)

step 5 = format disk = using mkfs.ext3 or mkfs.ext4 /dev/sd* ,
type mkfs & press tab key = to see all available formatting methods
there are different types of formatting commands (ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, cramfs, fat, msdos, btrfs, minix, vfat) 
some other fs formates (ZFS, GFS, HDFS, CIFS, NFS)
there is no thumb rule to use any specific format for any specific version
Format          ext2    ext3    ext4    xfs
RHEL Linux OS    v4      v5      v6     v7/8

step 6 = mkdir <folder-name>
step 7 = mount /dev/sd* /<dir-name> = to mount driver to a folder
step 8 = df -h = check mounted partition

this mount is not persistent it is loaded into ram if machine is reloaded then  the partition will be unmount
so to make it persistent & auto mount  we have to add it inot /etc/fstab file
why to add into fstab file ? because it's a boot process file means it loads when machine 
load/boots it stores mounting details
fstab means = file system table, it is said to be 9th critical file in linux
Q: how many fields in fstab file?
A: There are 6 fields

umount /<dir-name>/ = to unmount partition
-----------------
in windows formatting is called data wipeout/ permenant delete 
in linux we use rm -rf for permenant delete

Q: does data deletes permenantly ?
A: No data never deletes just it's reference is deleted, data can be recoverd by data recovery tool, if data is
   overridden then it can not be recoverd

in Linux format means to create or recreate file system, create index data or metadata, metadata means data of data
metadata = (my own detail) is information about a file: user ID of who owns it, permissions, file type (special, regular, 
named pipe, etc) and which disk-blocks the file uses

filesystem creates index like book
filesystem = metadata or collection of indexing data
FS includes = (Inode + InodeTable + Blocks + SuperBlocks + Mount Information ) in indexing
In Partition FS takes small space even if there is no data written

Q: 6 Partitions how many drivers ?
A: There will be 7 drivers  sdb, sdb1, sdb2, sdb3, sdb4, sdb5, sdb6

Q: if 7 drivers & 6 partitions how many FS will be created ?
A: There will be 6 FS means equal as per partiton count  

Q: if 7 drivers & 6 partitions how many partition table will be created ?
A: There will be 1 partition table

/etc/fstab
it is used to create automount on system reboot, it has 6 arguments
1 - device driver
2 - mount point
3 - fileSystem type
4 - permission
5 - fsckdump
6 - fsck on off sequence

for example:
/dev/sdb1            /phpmyadmin          ext4               default         0           0
(device driver)      (mount point)   (fileSystem type)    (permission)   (fsckdump)   (fsckOnOffSequence)

in v6 or earlier

add mount device as like given example above

in v7/8

add mount device as like given example above
or
blkid = this command create UUID for all device drivers

UUID                       /<dir-name>        fileSystemType     default          0                0 
(device driver UUID)      (mount point)   (fileSystem type)    (permission)   (fsckdump)   (fsckOnOffSequence)
