in technical term comprssion is called deflated & decompress is called inflated
file <file-name> = to know about file type

mv <filename> <fileNewName> = to rename file
alsp use rename command

mv <filename> ./path/<fileNewName> = to move file from current folder to child folder
mv <filename> /path/<fileNewName> = to move file from current folder to other folder
 cp command to copy file

to compress single file
when we run compression it creates headers metadata to compress file
gzip  = for small size files bit fast low compression
bzip2 = for large size files bit slow high compression
xz    = for compression
