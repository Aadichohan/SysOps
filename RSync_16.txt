Backup Types

1-  Full Backup
2 - Incremental Backup
3 - Differettial Backup
4 - Camulative Backup


Rsync uses Inremental Type of Backup, Rsync on copies the files & folders to the remote machine or folder  or tap drive 
does not compress or archives it for this we use tar or zip using pipe like rsync | tar, rsync | zip 
by default cp does not copy folders on files are copied to copy folders we use -rf flag = recurcive force

cp -rf /opt/my-files/*    /home/user/Downlaods = to copy all files with absolute path to a destination = 3
-rvf = recurcive verbose force
Q: How use Rsync with tar & zip ?


first use of cp command
cp --help
cp  <file-name> <destination-path> = to copy files to a destination
cp *   <destination-path>          = to copy all files with relative path to a destination         = 1
cp ./*               /home/user/Downlaods = to copy all files with relative 'path to a destination = 2
cp /opt/my-files/*    /home/user/Downlaods = to copy all files with absolute path to a destination = 3

Q: Which cp command is better 1, 2 or 3 ?
A: 3 is better because if admin comes 3rd day and he is on root / and he presses up key to find previously excuted
   command and if it is 1,2 then all root files & folders will be copied to that folder unlike 1,2 3 wiil excuted 
   absolute path then it will copy on specific folder's data so it's safe.

on every attempt cp command copies all files and  paste new file & overwrites previous files
rsync is better than cp because rsync does not overwrites

-p = preserve permission
-a = archive mode
-r = recursive
-v = verbose
-z - compress

rsync --help
rsync <options> <source> <destination>
rsync  /part1/*  /part2/      = to backup all files from this partition to another but skipping directories
rsync -rv  /part1/*  /part2/  = to backup all files & folders from this partition to another recurcively
rsync -arv /part1/*  /part2/  = to backup all files & folders with archive from this partition to another
rsync -parv /part1/*  /part2/ = to backup all files & folders with archive, preserved permission, recurcively, 
                                 verbose from this partition to another

rsync -avz /part1/*  /part2/  = to backup all files & folders with archive, compress, verbose from this partition 
                                to another

rsync -parvz /part1/*  /part2/  = to backup all files & folders with archive, preserved permission, recurcively, 
                                 verbose, compress from this partition to another

use include & exclude flags

stat <filenme> = command to check statistic about file
NOTE: Rsync does not read the content it just campare accesstime(atime) and modifytime(mtime) and overwrite whole file
Access Time (atime)
Modify Time (mtime)
Change Time (ctime)

if file is accessed then atime is changed
if file content is modified then mtime is changed
if ownership, access permission or content is changed then ctime is updated

Rsync compares source & destination files modified time, if any chnages in source then it will copy only the 
incremental data

Linux backup tools : tar, zip, rsync, cp, scp
gzip, bzip2 are not backup tool  these dont create new files they just compress file and change extension 
Organaization backup application
1 - Comercial application:
  > Veritas NetBackup
  > Windows NT Backup
  > TSM
  > Veeam
  > Dell Networker
  > EMC Networker
  >
2 - Open Source application:
  > AMANDA 
  > ZAMANDA
  > BACULA
  > BACKUPC

 
Rsync is also used for remote machine backup, 2 protocols are used ssh, scp syntax for remote backup is:
rsync -parvz <or any flags> <source-path> <remote-server-ip:path>
rsync -parvz ./*  172.174.44.3:/usr/files/ = for destination root user asks for passwrd
rsync -parvz ./*  sharfu@172.174.44.3:/usr/files/ = for destination non root user asks for passwrd

Q: Delete files from detination that does not exist in source ?
A: rsync -parvh --delete /source/  /destination/
Dont use * if you are deleting files from destination

Q: Search Rsync 15 Example ?
