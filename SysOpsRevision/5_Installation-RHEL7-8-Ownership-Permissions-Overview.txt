.iso is box image collection of files

centOs 6 has both 32 & 64 bit option 
but CentOs 7 & 8 has only 64 bit option
x86-64 = is 64 bit  architecture

i368/i586/i686 = is 32 bit archirecture

arch = check os architechture of os
uname --help
uname = check os & hardware information 
uname -m = check os architechture of os

for example a package voko
32 bit = voko_i386
64 bit = voko_x86_64
both   =  voko_noarch

CentOs7 Installation

7 partition are standard and recomended

Type-of-file 
There are 7 type of files
1) l = softlink file
2) d = directory
3) - = regular file
4) b = block file
5) c = character file
6) s = socket file
7) p = pipe device file

when we create file then by default it creates owner & group with user who created this file

There are 9 fields
r = read
w = write
x = execute

rw-    r--  r-- = there are 9 bits
user group other

123 456 789
--- = 000 = 0 = it means bitoff  Nill permission
r-- = 400 = 4 = 1st bit on, 2nd bit off, 3rd bit off
rw- = 420 = 6 = 1st bit on, 2nd bit on, 3rd bit off
rwx = 421 = 7 = 1st bit on, 2nd bit on, 3rd bit on means all bits on, full permission

in binary
r = read  = 4
w = write = 2
