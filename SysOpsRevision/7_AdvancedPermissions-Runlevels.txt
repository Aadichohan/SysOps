Runlevel / Targets

runlevel are different modes in linux


=== command ===
runlevel = to check prev & current runlevel
init <runlevel-num> = to move to different runlevel 

========== Read Write  Execute ===========
no read write execute permission required to delete file atleast for only owner
(the owner and group without read cat file inside 
                    dir but cannot list ls)
For Files:
r = read, copy    | can read and copy file
w = write, delete | can write/modify content
x = run           | can execute this file

For Folder (a box):
r = read          | can read folders & files inside this folder (only owner & group without read cat file inside 
                    dir but cannot list ls)
w = write         | can add files & folder into this folder
x = execute       | can cd into this folder from terminal or can get in the folder by double clicking from gui

inherited permission:

Note: if user, group or other has
w = permission for folder can create file inside folder & file has no permission
can write content inside file by using override !

chmod -Rv <sybol/octal> <file-name> = to add permission to folder and child folders &
                                      files to add same permission -R recursively & -v verbose for printing details
                                     

======chattr======
chattr = chattr stands for change attribute somthing like permission to prevent all user including root admin user
to delete file/folder even useing rm -rf command prevent to delete
chattr has many attributes for example i
i (+i, -i) = immutable
a          = append
chattr +i <file/folder-name> = to enaable immutable mode
chattr -i <file/folder-name> = to disable immutable mode

chattr +i not recommended to run on system files because system files generates log if we run this command
this wiil prevent to generate logs it has to be run on our own data files

lsattr <file/folder-name> = to list & check attributes of file 

========= Advance Permission ==========
Access control list (ACL)

setfacl --help
setfacl -m u:<username>:<rwx(optional permission)> <file/folder-name> = to add user specific permission
setfacl -m g:<groupname>:<rwx(optional permission)><file/folder-name> = to add group specific permission
setfacl -m o:<rwx(optional permission)><file/folder-name>             = to add other specific permission
setfacl -m u:<username>:<rwx(optional perm)>,g:<groupname>:<rwx(optional perm)>,
           o:<rwx(optional permission)><file/folder-name>             = to add other specific permission

setfacl -x u:<username> <file/folder-name>                            = to remove user specific permission
setfacl -x g:<groupname><file/folder-name>                            = to remove group specific permission


setfacl -b              <file/folder-name>                            = to remove all user, group permission


======== Runlevel / Targets =========
As windows has serveral modes: 
1) safe mode
2) normal mode
3) network mode

as like that lunux has runlevel or targets
1) in rhel/centos 6 or earliar called runlevel
2) in rhel/centos 7 or 8 called targets

from 0-6 there are total 7 runlevels
runlevel   = to check current runlevel return 2 number 1st is prev runlevel (if shows N means nothing) 
             2nd is current runlevel
init <0-6> = to goto runlevel
1) 0 = Halt (poweroff)
2) 1 = Single usermode
3) 2 = multi user mode without networking
4) 3 = console based multi user mode with networking
5) 4 = user defined mode
6) 5 = GUI based multi user mode with networking
7) 6 = reboot
