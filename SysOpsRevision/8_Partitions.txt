Hardisk = it is a storage device where we wtire data
Hard Disk Type
1) SATA
2) PATA
3) SSD
4) SAS
5) USB
6) SAN
7) NAS

HDD Manufacturing companies give the warranty of HDD because it has magnet & by the time it loses its magnetic power mostly company give 3yrs to 5yrs warranty & after that warranty some time it shows input output error writing of data across sectors is called flashing & it is stored in 0 1 binary
In CentOS 6 or earlier it was calculated in cylinders
In CentOS 7 it’s calculated in sectors 
To see hard disk in OS we use device drivers, device drivers are low level program & are interface between Respected software and Hardware, at last drivers are a program in a file
For Hard Disk drivers it can be /dev/sda , /dev/sdb , /dev/sdc they are loaded initially in ram memory
For example we have 80GB Hard Disk  & it’s associated with /dev/sda then we create 3 partition into it
Of (20, 20, 40) GBs then drivers will be associated like this
Total Hard Disk = /dev/sda
20GB = /dev/sda1
20GB = /dev/sda2 
40GB = /dev/sda23




Another example 100GB
It will have 5 drivers
Of (25, 25, 20, 30) GBs then drivers will be associated like this
Total Hard Disk = /dev/sdb
25GB = /dev/sdb1
25GB = /dev/sdb2 
20GB = /dev/sdb3
30GB = /dev/sdb4

Linux Partition Hard Disk
  Disk Druid:
    Disk Druid is part of the Red Hat installation program. It features a user-friendly interface, so if                           
    it does all that you need, by all means use it in place of Linux fdisk
Tools Command
  Fdisk, Sfdisk, Cfdisk, Parted
Fdisk has limitation that it cannot create more than 2TB partition

                                                  
CAT Task:
1)	Add Hard disk                            (800MB)
2)	Discover hard disk                    
3)	Make partition in hard disk
4)	Write partition
5)	Update kernel table
6)	Mount partition

List all disk partition /dev/sd*
Fdisk –l                  = to list all /dev/sd*
Fdisk –l /dev/sdb = to list details of  /dev/sdb
Step 1: In VM add virtual hard disk using vm settings
Step 2: The discover hard disk without rebooting using command:
 Command =  echo  “- - -“ > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan 
Step 3 make partition using fdisk :
1)	To view fdisk menu type m
2)	To make new partition type n
3)	To make primary partition type p after typing n
Note: There can be total 4 primary partition if we have to make 6 partition first we need to 3 primary partitions then create an extended partition with whole remaining memory sectors or cylinders then create 4th, 5th & 6th primary partitions with respective size

4)	To write newly made partition type w
5)	To print newly made partition type p
6)	To delete partition type d
Step 4  w – save   = update partition table
Step 5 Partx –a     = update partition table
           Partx –a <sd*>
Step 6 format driver & create file system
            Command =  mkfs.ext4 <driver> = mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdd
Step 7
        Make directory
Step 8 mount partition
         Mount <device-driver> </dir> = mount /dev/sdb1 /tomcat
Step 9 
          Verify using df -h
Step 10
       Persist mount point on reboot using fstab file
