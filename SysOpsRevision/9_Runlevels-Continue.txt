There are 7 run levels starts from {0} to {6}
runlevel = to find current & last runevel
N = nothing
S = Single UserMode
init <runlevel-num> = to navigate to specific runlevel

2 runlevel is console based terminal it has 6 vcs (virtual console)
3 runlevel is console based terminal it has 6 VCS consoles (virtual console)
4 runlevel is console based terminal it has 6 vcs (virtual console)
5 runlevel is GUI based mode & it has approx. 400 gnome terminals

we can switch back & forth using exmple: 
1) alt+f1 to console1 = tty1
2) alt+f2 to console2 = tty2
3) alt+f3 to console3 = tty3
4) alt+f4 to console4 = tty4
5) alt+f5 to console5 = tty5
6) alt+f6 to console6 = tty6
in vm or actual os when we type ps (process) it shows
tty{vcs-num} 
tty{1-6}
like on console vcs1   = tty1 & console vcs2 = tty2
tty = teletype terminal
if we delete any driver of tty{0-6} then it will not might open that vcs console
ps = to check process status it show the current tty

Note: if we switch from runlevel 3 to 0,1,2,4,5,6 then all operation of vcs in runlevel 3 will be closed 
& new vcs of rulevel 4 will be open & if we press alt+f2 to switch from tty1 to tty2 it does not stop
previous vsc & open another upto 6

pts = seudo terminal secondary
in runlevel 5 it uses pts driver for terminal and it is approx. 400
means you can use approx. 400 terminal


RunLevels & Details
Linux has 7 runlevel {0..6}
Runlevel 0   |  Shutdown System
Runlevel 1   |  Single User Mode
Runlevel 2   |  Multi User Mode without networking
Runlevel 3   |  Console Based Multi User Mode with networking
Runlevel 4   |  User Defined Mode
Runlevel 5   |  GUI Based Multi User Mode with networking
Runlevel 6   |  Reboots the System to restart it

in runlevel 3 it uses by default console but it can use gui as well
startx   = to switch from console to gui in runlevel 3 without using run level 5
pkill x   = to switch from gui to console where X = gui X server

ctrl + shift + n = to open new terminal

runlevel uses pts = stands for pseudo terminal secondary 
ps = to check current pts/{num}
starts from 0 to 399 approx.
if we are in runlevel 5 then it uses pts
there are approx 400 gnome terminal & if we use putty to connect remotely from another system to our linux os
on runlevel 3 then it also uses pts & we can use approx upto 400 teminal


=== boot process ===
1) power on
2) splash screen
3) /etc/inittab

==== in CentOS6 ====
https://www.thegeekdiary.com/set-password-for-single-user-mode-on-linux-centos-rhel/

To set default runlevel after poweron or reboot
inside /etc/inittab file find id:<num>:initdefault:
and set you required runlevel number to default init
 
To prevent login without password in single usermode/runlevel 1
edit file /etc/sysconfig/init then find SINLGE=/sbin/sushell
and replace SINGLE=/sbin/sulogin
where SINGLE = Tag & it is assigned value
then goto run level 1 and enter root password  you will see bash-4.1# 
to goto root user type sudo -i
 
interview Q: how to recover root password
to goto runlevel 1 into rescue mode intrupt session splash screen 
then find rhgb quiet then after that type 1 or s and boot
root# passwd root  = then type passwd root to change root password
=== End CentOS6 ===

Q: if server runlevel is 5 & we use putty to connect what is the runlevel in putty terminal ?
A: it always shows server's current runlevel

==== centOS7/8 ====

=== single user mode ===
1) intrupt splash screen
2) the find linux16 & rhgb quit then type 1 togo to single usermode

https://www.unixmen.com/reset-root-password-centos-7/

method 1
1) power on
2) intrupt splash screen
3) find line linux16 & find ro & remove ro & type rw init=/sysroot/bin/sh then press ctrl+x to boot  
4) chroot /sysroot = then you'll see shell then type 
5) passwd root     = to change root passwd
6) touch /.autorelabel
7) exit
8) reboot


Q: Can we use start x in runlevel 3
    Case#1 : if we install desktop GUI Server then Yes because it has X server installed
    Case#2 : if we istall minimal centOS then No because it has not installed X server
             we have to install X server package
