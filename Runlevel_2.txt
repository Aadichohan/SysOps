Runlevel 2,3,4 user VCS
VCS = virtual console
ps = process status
* there can be up to 6 vcs
* if we use command ps it shows tty1 if  we press Alt+F2 it opens second console
and tty3 is created and then press Alt+F3 it opens third console tty3 and till 
Alt+F6 so on so forth
tty1, tty2, tty3, tty4, tty5, tty6
* tty = teletype terminal
* if we goto run 2 or 4 from 3 it terminates all previous vcs and open new vcs
* if we are at runlvel 3 by default it loads vcs but after that we can load 
GUI Gnome but it just uses tty driver  not pts and not like fully runlevel 5
mostly compinies use runlevel 3

* if we use runlevel 5 graphical GUI it uses Gnome terminal
and it uses pts if we type ctrl+shift+n it opens new terminal and it uses pts1
and there can be approx. upto 400 terminals 
* if at runlevel 5 by default it starts Gnome terminal if it fails to start gui it open vcs
* pts = Pseudo terminal Secondary

* if we use putty for taking remote connection from windows of linux machine
putty uses pts and it show system current runlevel

startx = to run GUI from runlevel 3
pkill x = to stop GUI from runlevel 3

case 1 = if user install GUI server it can run startx from runlevel 3
case 2 = if user install minimal it can not run startx from runlevel 3 to run GUI
because GUI package is not installed but the package can be installed using yum

runlevel    purpose
 0           Shutdown
 1           Single user mode
 2           Multiuser without networking
 3           Multiuser with networking
 4           Unused
 5           GUI with networking
 6           Reboot
 
1- when the machine is powered on 
2- splash screen shows
3 - then it loads /etc/inittab in CentOs 6 or earliar version
and in CentOs 7/8 it loads default.target from /etc/inittab
for initiliazing defult runlevel

case 1 = if we set default runlevel 6 in /etc/inittab in CentOs 6 or older version
and set default target in CentOs 7/8 it keeps rebooting
to solve this we need to interupt splash screen by pressing in CentOs 6 down arrow
 and a to modify and in CentOs 7/8 press e
then type 5 for going to runlevel 5 and enter and  in CentOs 7/8
find linux16 linux /vwlinuz ....... UTF8 at the end <space> type 5 and press CTRL+X
to go to go on runlevel 5 temperary to reset default runlevel
* set default runlevel

shutdow -r now = for shutdown and reboot system
CentOs 6 or older
id:5:initdefault: set this by sing vi editor

CentOs 7/8

systemctl set-default <runlevel0.target>
systemctl set-default <poweroff.target>


systemctl set-default <runlevel2.target>
systemctl set-default <multi- user.target>

systemctl set-default <runlevel3.target>
systemctl set-default <multi- user.target>

systemctl set-default <runlevel5.target>
systemctl set-default <graphical.target>

systemctl get-default = for printing default runlevel

Run Level	Target Units	                 Description
0	runlevel0.target, poweroff.target	   Shut down and power off
1	runlevel1.target, rescue.target	           Set up a rescue shell
2,3,4	runlevel[234].target, multi- user.target   Set up a nongraphical multi-user shell
5	runlevel5.target, graphical.target	   Set up a graphical multi-user shell
6	runlevel6.target, reboot.target	           Shut down and reboot the system

Case 1 = if we forgot root password
then in CentOs 6 or older
press arrow to interupt and press a to modify
and press 1 then it goes to the root directly without password
then can update  root password

in CentOs 7/8
 intrupt splash screen by pressing e and find linux16 /vwlinuz ....... UTF8
and at the end of line press space and type rd.break then press ctrl+x promt shows like
switch_root:/# mount -o remount rw /sysroot
switch_root:/# chroot /sysroot/
sh-4.2# passwd root = to update root password
sh-4.2# touch /.autorelabel
sh-4.2# exit
switch_root:/# exit

* To Secure single usermode with password
cd /etc/sysconfig
in CentOs 6 or older
vi init
#Set to  '/sbin/sulogin' to prompt for password on single-user mode
#Set to '/sbin/sushell' to login without password
# SINGLE TAG
SINGLE = /sbin/sushell
or
SINGLE = /sbin/sulogin

in CentOs 7/8 single mode user is bydefault password protected
but it can go to root by rd.break password reset sysroot method without password 
 to protect it visit site:

using ths command  = grub2-setpassword
